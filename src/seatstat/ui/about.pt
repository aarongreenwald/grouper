                Welcome to SeatStat, the classroom seating solution. 
                This app is under construction and is not really ready for public consumption.
                Both the layout and content are subject to change dramatically and without notice,
                and the accuracy of the results is not guaranteed.                 
                Please manually verify any results before relying on them.                                
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm still not sure exactly what this thing will do when it finally does things.
                Your feedback and suggestions are welcome. 
                Please use the little lightbulb on the bottom
                of the page to submit feedback or suggest features for SeatStat
                so that others can see what's planned and vote on features. 
                But if you hate other teachers, and like to kill kittens for fun,
                you can <a href="mailto:support@seatstat.com">email me</a>
                your thoughts, too.
