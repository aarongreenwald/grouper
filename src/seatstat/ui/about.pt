                <p>
                    Welcome to SeatStat, the classroom seating solution. 
                    SeatStat saves you time and energy by generating a 
                    workable seating chart for your classroom in no time.
                    Just tell it the names of your students, how many tables
                    you have (and how many students sit at each), and who 
                    can't sit with <span title="whom? I'm so scared of making 
                    grammar mistakes. All these teachers around me!">who<span>.
                </p>
             
                <p>   
                    That's it! SeatStat generates a seating chart for you.
                    Just realized that SeatStat put two children that probably
                    should be separated at the same table? No problem. With a few
                    clicks, you can add the pair under the restrictions section and 
                    regenerate the seating chart. Want to mix it up? Just click 
                    the Shuffle button to move everyone around while honoring your
                    restrictions.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Feedback</h4>
                <p>            
                    SeatStat is developed by 
                        <a href="http://www.aarongreenwald.com">Aaron Greenwald</a>,
                        otherwise referred to by pronouns such as "me" and "I"
                        because I feel really odd speaking about myself in the third person.
                    I do this as a hobby in my free time, so I cannot guarantee
                    that SeatStat will work very well or do what you want it to.
                    But I'm working on it anyway, so your feedback and suggestions are welcome. 
                    Please use the little lightbulb on the bottom
                    of the page to submit feedback or suggest features for SeatStat
                    so that others can see what's planned and vote on features. 
                    You can also <a href="mailto:support@seatstat.com">email me</a> directly if you'd like.                                                                    
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Also, please note that SeatStat is still in beta and is just getting started.
                    If there's enough interest, I'd consider adding support
                    for classrooms with desks instead of tables, requirements
                    for specific students (or types of students, like students with
                    certain skills) to sit together, and more. Your feedback
                    will help prioritize what gets done and what doesn't.

                <h4>Legal Notice</h4>
                <p style="font-style:italic">  
                    (Here belongs a long legal notice in tiny print with big 
                    words that I don't understand. 
                    
                     The basic idea 
                    is that this thing is a work in progress, and you're not 
                    paying for it, so I don't really feel bad that it sucks. 
                    There will be bugs, which I will try to fix if you report them to me.
                    And there will (I hope) be lots of new features in the future.
                    You can influence what I work on by taking the time to let 
                    me know what you'd like.)

                    Ok, here's the abbreviated version. I borrowed it from the MIT
                    License because it sounds smart and I like sounding smart.
